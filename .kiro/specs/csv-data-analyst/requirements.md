# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CSV Data Analyst is an AI-powered application that enables users to interact with CSV data through natural language queries. Built with Streamlit for the frontend, LangChain for AI orchestration, and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API (gemini-1.5-flash-latest model) as the language model, this tool transforms complex data analysis into conversational interactions. The system uses a clean separation between the Streamlit UI, LangChain agent, and the underlying LLM, with the agent powered by ChatGoogleGenerativeAI and utilizing create_pandas_dataframe_agent with matplotlib/plotly visualization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I can upload a CSV file so that I can provide my data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format
3. WHEN a valid CSV file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse and load the data into a pandas DataFrame
4. WHEN an invalid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF the CSV file cannot be parsed THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I can see a preview of the uploaded data so that I can confirm the correct file has been loaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CSV file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display the first few rows of the data
2. WHEN displaying the preview THEN the system SHALL show column names and basic data information
3. WHEN displaying the preview THEN the system SHALL show the total number of rows and columns
4. WHEN the preview is shown THEN the system SHALL indicate the data is ready for analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I can ask questions about the data in natural language so that I can perform data analysis without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for natural language questions
2. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL process the query using the LangChain pandas DataFrame agent
3. WHEN processing a question THEN the system SHALL use the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI with gemini-1.5-flash-latest model
4. WHEN a question is submitted THEN the system SHALL maintain context of the uploaded dataset
5. IF no data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to upload a file first

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I can get a textual answer to my questions so that I can quickly understand the key insights from the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive textual response
2. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL include relevant statistics and findings
3. WHEN describing insights THEN the system SHALL use clear, understandable language
4. WHEN analysis involves calculations THEN the system SHALL explain the results clearly
5. IF the question cannot be answered with available data THEN the system SHALL explain why

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I can request data visualizations (like bar charts or line graphs) so that I can see a visual representation of the data trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question involves data that can be visualized THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate charts using matplotlib or plotly
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL choose suitable chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram, etc.)
3. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL include proper titles, axis labels, and formatting
4. WHEN visualizations are created THEN the system SHALL display them within the Streamlit interface
5. IF visualization is not applicable to the question THEN the system SHALL provide only textual analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, the application should maintain conversational memory so that I can ask follow-up questions about previous answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asking questions THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history within the session
2. WHEN referencing previous analysis THEN the system SHALL understand context from earlier questions
3. WHEN displaying responses THEN the system SHALL show the conversation flow
4. WHEN asking follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL build upon previous context
5. WHEN starting a new session THEN the system SHALL initialize fresh conversation memory
